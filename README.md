# Honeybot
Proof of concept automated revenge against unwelcome SSH clients.

Automatically performs one teardrop attack against any IP address that successfully connects via SSH. This is a proof of concept only. All liability remains with the user, who should only be performing attacks like this on and against systems and networks they own and control. 

This is not a secure setup, there's things like forced commands and network witchery this has not been tested against. A user must connect successfully before the script initiates, so don't run this from a secure network or a system with sensative information on it, or even a system that has indirect access to a secure network. You have been warned.
